# Welcome to Car-Help!

(The name is subject to change of-course...)
This is the client-side application, designed to help users find their nearest mechanics and contact them for assistance. It utilizes a centralized and scalable database provided by Firebase Firestore and is written completely in flutter. We made this app to explore Flutter's complex UI navigation and state management while learning a bit about databases.
